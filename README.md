# This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset. It merges two datasets (tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv) on movie titles and extracts useful metadata such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The data is preprocessed by converting stringified lists to Python objects using ast.literal_eval(), selecting the top 3 cast members and director, removing null values and duplicates, and combining all textual information into a single tags column. The text is then cleaned, normalized, and stemmed using NLTK's PorterStemmer, and vectorized using CountVectorizer with a limit of 5000 most frequent words and English stop word removal. Cosine similarity is computed between movie vectors to identify similar movies. When a user inputs a movie title, the system retrieves the most similar titles based on content. Libraries used include pandas, numpy, nltk, ast, and sklearn. Users can run the script in a Python environment and call the recommend('Movie Name') function to receive recommendations.
